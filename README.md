### Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis
This project was carried out during my internship at Unified Mentor to analyze heart disease diagnostic data. The objective was to better prepare for future health challenges by uncovering key insights and trends related to heart disease.

### Project Objectives
Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL): Efficiently handle and prepare data from a heart disease diagnostic database.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover insights from the data to understand heart disease rates, and analyze heart disease by gender and age.
Visualization and Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive and informative visualizations to display key metrics and relationships between attributes.

### Key Analyses Performed
#### Heart Disease Rates:

Investigated overall heart disease rates and trends in the dataset.

#### Heart Disease by Gender:

Analyzed differences in heart disease prevalence between males and females to identify any significant patterns.

#### Heart Disease by Age:

Examined how age impacts heart disease rates to determine age-related trends.

#### Comparative Analysis:

Compared various attributes such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and their relationship with heart disease to identify key factors affecting heart disease.

### Tools & Technologies Used
#### Power BI: 
Used for the entire project, including data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and dashboard creation.

#### Outcomes & Insights
Significant Trends and Correlations:
Discovered important trends and correlations in the data that can help in understanding and managing heart disease better.

#### Impact of Gender and Age:
Highlighted the impact of gender and age on heart disease prevalence, providing valuable insights for targeted health interventions.

#### Comprehensive Dashboard:
Developed a detailed dashboard that presents the data in a clear and actionable manner, making it easier to interpret and use the findings.
